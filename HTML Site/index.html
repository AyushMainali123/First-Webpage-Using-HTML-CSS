			I started coding career in early 2019. I was unknown about what programming was before that period. Speaking about my first programming language, I learnt C programming language as my first programming language. And coming to this day, I am glad that I chose C as my first programming language because I got the core concept of pointers and how memory works. It was difficult for me to grasp those concept at first, but after alot of research and  enthusiasm, I finally got concept of pointers, memory allocation and deallocation during run times. After studying for 2 to 3 month I decided to make my very own mini game(tic- tac- toe) on <span><strong>Code::Blocks</strong></span>. I made this game without watching any youtube tutorials and was impressed of myself. This small game motivated me alot.
			I also made library management program(which took record of  all the books avialiable in library and all the borrowed books.) and many other small programs.

			I used to hear about data structures and algorithm alot those days and was enthusiastic  to know what it was. So I bought <strong>"Data structures using C "- Udit Agrawal</strong> . I learnt what stack, linked list and queue was but my mind was unmotivated to learn about tree, graph and other data structures that time. I took break from programming for some days. Then I paused learning data structures for some period and started learning C++. I learned about concept of object oriented programming(OOP) in C++. It didn't took time for me to become familiar with C++ as I had pretty good knowledge of C. 
		</p>
		<p class="blue-paragraph">
			So I started programming in C++ rather than C. I continued learning DS from C++ and started being familiar with stl(Standard Template Library) which is a boon for problem solving. Recently, I am getting started in programming contest on different sites(hackerearth.com, codechef.com  ) but I am struggling a lot. I am sure I will not get unmotivated and continue making new projects and be better in problem solving.
